# git-as-dropbox (GAD, the cheap dropbox alternative for developers)

Convert any git repository into a cheap Dropbox-like folder. For example, users A and B can share content on save-time (not real-time or keystroke-time) by running `git-as-dropbox ./my-repo` each. Now, when user A adds/deletes/modifies a file, user B will receive these changes and vice versa. All through git and without disrupting your original repository settings. GAD uses good ol' time polling to avoid the clunkiness of file watching in some old OS. Works across Windows, Linux, Mac and actually just anything that can run git commands.

GAD creates a copy of your _.git_ as _.git-as-dropbox_. All sync operations happen on this cloned repo. Each change becomes a new commit in the local _git-as-dropbox_ branch. These changes are pushed and end up in your remote _git-as-dropbox_ branch. Since GAD always uses _git-as-dropbox_ you can continue working with your repository as you normally would. The only change to your original repository is that the line ".git-as-dropbox" will be added to your _.gitignore_ file.

## Prerequisites

 - Node 9 or higher
 - Git (if you can `git pull` and `git push` from your CLI you are good to go)

## Usage

 - Install with `npm install --global git-as-dropbox`.
 - Run `git-as-dropbox <repository-path>` on two different computers. When you first run GAD both repositories better be in sync to avoid initial git conflicts.
 - Any change will now be shared across both computers.

## Features

 - GAD respects your current git workflow. You can continue adding, committing and pushing to your original repository as you normally do.
 - If two users commit the same line at the same time GAD will just commit the conflict so that any user can resolve it.
 - Tested on Windows, Linux, Mac.

## Caveats

 - GAD creates a full copy of your current _.git_ folder. This means you will see a new _.git-as-dropbox_ folder in your project. This will make your current project twice as big in terms of disk usage. This should not be a problem unless you have an extremely very big repository.
 - GAD uses polling. It is the safest way to make it work across all OS.
 - This tool is not designed to work with several users at the same time over the same file. It is merely a quick and cheap way to share files through git in a similar fashion Dropbox does.

## Special cases

There are few special cases when several users edit at the same time. These are:

 - **When user A and user B edit the same line at the same time:** Dropbox would create two files, _file.txt_ and _file.txt (user's conflicted copy 00/00/0000)_. In GAD, both users will receive the conflict information as shown below.

This way any user can fix the conflict.
 - **When user A and B rename the same file at the same time:** Both users will receive both files.
 - **When multiple users edit the same file at the same time:** It will very likely create an unintelligible commit diff or it may just crash. GAD is not suitable for this scenario. If you want to allow multiple users editing take a look at my other project, [boy.dog](www.boy.dog), which uses Operational Transforms to sync multiple users in real time.

## FAQ

##### Does git-as-dropbox change my local repository?
No. Your local repository is left untouched. This means that your current local branch (of _.git_) will be "master".

##### Does git-as-dropbox change external repositories?
Yes. GAD creates the _git-as-dropbox_ branch in your remote repository. All changes are pushed to this branch and this is how files are sync'ed to other computers.

##### How do completely remove GAD from tracking a repository?
Stop GAD if currently running. Remove the _.git-as-dropbox_ hidden folder from your proyect. And delete the _git-as-dropbox_ branch from your external repository. GAD does not make changes to your original repository, however if you ever fetched all branches in a local repo you might want to delete these too.

##### GAD closes when I disconnect from my the server. Why?
This is normal. Any NodeJS app running on yor CLI will close as you disconnect from the server. To keep GAD running use `nohup`. For example `nohup git-as-dropbox ./my-repo &`.

##### Why can't I see GAD changes with `git log`?
Because GAD uses the *.git-as-dropbox* repository which lives next to your *.git* repository. If you want to see GAD's git log run GAD with `guiPort` and go to "localhost:[your guiPort]". Alternatively you can simply use `git --git-dir=.git-as-dropbox log`.

##### I get an error at "make-dir.js:85" 
GAD requires Node 9 or higher.
